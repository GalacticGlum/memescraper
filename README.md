# Memescraper
Memescraper is a small Python program that scrapes memes from [quickmeme.com](http://quickmeme.com/).
It works by pulling "page" html files from [quickmeme.com](http://quickmeme.com/) and then parsing the html contents for links that start with [http://s.quickmeme.com/img/](http://s.quickmeme.com/img/).
